# Metadata Utils
Unfortunately, the SuperMerger does not save the metadata when merging checkpoints or Loras. Since I like to have an overview of what is in each checkpoint or Lora, I wrote a small extension for the WebUI. Automatic1111 and ForgeUI are currently supported.

My Metadata Utils can read metadata from .Savetensor files and also write them.

If support for other WebUIs is required, please create a pull request.

Installation:

To install in the WebUI, clone this repository under Extensions -> Install from URL or simply copy and paste here https://github.com/Tzigo/Metadata_Utils.git.

Click on install and then restart the UI.
